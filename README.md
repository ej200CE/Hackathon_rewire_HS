# FoodAdvisor - AI-Powered Local Dietary Recommendation Platform

## üéØ Project Overview

FoodAdvisor is an innovative dietary recommendation platform that connects users with personalized nutrition advice while leveraging real-time product data from local Dutch supermarkets. Our platform goes beyond generic meal suggestions by providing actionable, location-specific recommendations that users can immediately act upon.

### Key Features

- **Personalized User Dossiers**: Each user maintains a comprehensive profile including dietary plans, requirements, preferences, and taste profiles
- **AI-Powered Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction with intelligent agents that understand nutritional needs and local product availability
- **Hyperlocal Recommendations**: Direct integration with Dutch supermarket inventories (currently Jumbo, with plans for Albert Heijn, Action, Lidl and more)
- **Actionable Guidance**: Specific instructions like "Buy product X at Jumbo location Y, prepare using method Z"
- **Comprehensive Planning**: From quick meal suggestions to long-term nutrition strategies
- **Budget & Nutrition Control**: Full transparency and control over costs and nutritional intake

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Current Tech Stack

#### Data Pipeline
- **Web Scraping**: Custom scrapers collect product data from supermarket websites
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for raw HTML storage
- **ETL Processing**: Python-based ETL pipeline (in progress) transforming HTML to structured data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS with normalized schema for products, prices, and nutrition data

#### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: Amazon AWS
- **Network**: VPC configuration for secure internal communication
- **Frontend**: Angular framework (basic structure implemented)

#### Database Schema
- `stores`: Supermarket locations and metadata
- `products`: Product catalog with flexible unit system
- `prices`: Historical price tracking with promotions
- `nutrition`: Standardized nutritional information per 100g/100ml
